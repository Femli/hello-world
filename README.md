# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello world, my name is Franco and I am just another student that is learning to use GitHub. I am a mathematics and computer science student, and I seek to learn about programming and mathematical methods that will allow me to:
- Do applied mathematical research on a veriety of topics (current interests are biological and ecosystem applications)
- Do some side projects such as video game developing, data analysis of personal data, and much more!

Welcome aboard :)
